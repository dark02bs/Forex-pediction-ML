\paragraph{Aim}
Our project is based on machine learning,employing the technique to predict the closing rates of the forex markets. Here, we constrict our study on the exchange rates of USD and Euro based on the per minute data available. We make use of the starting rate,its maximimum and its minimum to predict its closing rate.

\paragraph{Skills required}
Practically not much is needed to know before you begin the project. A fine understanding of any programming language like C or Java is enough.

\paragraph{Skills acquired}
During the course of the project we learnt a lot of new skills
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Python
		\item Git
		\item Lua
	\end{enumerate}
